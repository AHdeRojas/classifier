The RDP Classifier is a naive Bayesian classifier which was developed to provide rapid taxonomic placement based on rRNA sequence data. 
The RDP Classifier can rapidly and accurately classify bacterial and archaeal 16s rRNA sequences, and Fungal LSU sequences. 
It provides taxonomic assignments from domain to genus, with confidence estimates for each assignment. 
The RDP Classifier likely can be adapted to additional phylogenetically coherent bacterial taxonomies.

QUICKSTART

ant jar
java -jar dist/classifier.jar

For 16S rRNA training data and Fungal LSU training data please download from http://sourceforge.net/projects/rdp-classifier/?source=directory. 
The project on SourceForge also contains the compiled RDP Classifier preconfigured with training data, along with sample data to re-train Classifier.


USAGE

1. classify a single sample
	It can use either the default trained data or user specified data.
	[Example command from a terminal]:
	java -Xmx1g -jar /path/to/classifier.jar 

2. classify multiple samples
	The MultiClassifier can classifiy multiple files at one time and offers more output choices. 
	[Example command from a terminal]:
	java -Xmx1g -jar /path/to/MultiClassifier.jar

3. compare two samples 
	[Example command from a terminal]:
	java -Xmx1g -cp /path/to/classifier.jar edu/msu/cme/rdp/classifier/comparison/ComparisonCmd	

4. estimate the accuracy of your own training data using leave-one-out testing
	see sampledata/README for more details.
	[Example command from a terminal]:
	java -Xmx1g -cp /path/to/classifier.jar edu/msu/cme/rdp/classifier/train/validation/leaveoneout/LeaveOneOutTesterMain

5. re-train the Classifier using your own training data 
	The format of the raw data can be found in sampledata directory.
	[Example command from a terminal]:
	java -Xmx1g -cp /path/to/classifier.jar edu/msu/cme/rdp/classifier/train/ClassifierTraineeMaker
